# cpp make configure 
This is a simple bash script that configures a C++ project with a Makefile.

The script creates a Makefile, CFLAGS.conf and a STD.conf file in the working directory.

The Make file follows the same structure as the one in my [cpp_template](https://www.github.com/awesomelewis/cpp_template) repository.

## Requirements
- bash

## Quick start
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomelewis2007/cpp_make_configure/master/src/configure.bash && bash configure.bash
```

## Usage
```bash
bash ./configure.bash
```
