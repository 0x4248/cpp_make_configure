# cpp make configure 
This is a simple bash script that configures a C++ project with a Makefile.

The script creates a Makefile, CFLAGS.conf and a STD.conf file in the working directory.

The Make file follows the same structure as the one in my [cpp_template](https://www.github.com/awesomelewis/cpp_template) repository.

## Requirements
- bash

## Usage
```bash
bash ./configure.bash
```
